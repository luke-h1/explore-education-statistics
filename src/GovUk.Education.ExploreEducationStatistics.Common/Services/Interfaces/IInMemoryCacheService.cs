/**
 * Interface for services that handle in-memory caches.
 *
 * There is deliberately no `Delete` method defined on this interface, as the client of this service should instead be
 * setting rules around cache expiry of the items being cached.
 *
 * The most important reason that there is no `Delete` method for use is that this in-memory caching strategy is
 * not distributed in any way and so a Delete operation invoked on a cache on a particular server instance would have no
 * effect on any additional servers running the same service elsewhere e.g. in a horizontally scaled service.
 *
 * Items that are subject to regular updates are therefore advised to be cached for a very short-lived timeframe so as
 * to prevent consumers from having to wait too long before the updated content is available.

/**
 * This enum allows us to specify that, in addition to the cache duration requested when setting an item in the cache,
 * the specified cache duration will be truncated so as to not exceed certain regular points of time during the day.
 *
 * As an example, if an item is being set in the cache at 2:27pm with a requested cache duration of 5 minutes, it would
 * expire at 2:32pm assuming that no ExpirySchedule was also requested when setting that item.
 *
 * However, if an item is being set in the cache at 2:27pm with a requested cache duration of 5 minutes AND an
 * ExpirySchedule of HalfHourly, then the cache duration will be truncated to expire the item at 2:30pm (i.e. on the
 * half hour).
 *
 * This allows us to request reasonably-sized cache durations for our items, but allowing us to expire them at certain
 * critical points during the day where we expect these items to potentially change.
